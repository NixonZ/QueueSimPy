# QueueSimPy

We follow a object oriented approach for creating a general Queueing System and getting simulated wait time data.
Further, we are also going to change the linear model to incorporate other ML techniques and hopefully create a better predictor.
**Check out our code documentation for c++ [here](https://nixonz.github.io/simulation/).**(Currently in work).

This repository will allow us to use the existing C++ code in python. The github repo for the simulator (C++) - [here](https://github.com/NixonZ/simulation).

For loading the simulator in python follow the following steps:

1. clone this repository.
2. pip install ./QueueSimPy
